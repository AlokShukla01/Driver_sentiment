Driver Sentiment Tracker
This project is a Driver Sentiment Monitoring System built using the MERN stack (React + Node.js + Express).

The system collects driver feedback (star rating or text), calculates performance using a rolling average, and triggers alerts when a driver becomes underperforming.

This version uses in-memory storage for simplicity (no MongoDB required).
